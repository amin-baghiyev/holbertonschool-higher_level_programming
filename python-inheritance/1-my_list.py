"""This script defines a custom list subclass called `MyList`.

`MyList` extends the built-in `list` class by adding a method to print
the list in a sorted order.

Usage:
    You can create an instance of `MyList`, add items to it, and then
    call the `print_sorted()` method to print the items in ascending order.

Example:
    my_list = MyList([3, 1, 2])
    my_list.print_sorted()  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
